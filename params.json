It was originally developed for the [ImageNet VID](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/index#vid) challenge introduced in [ILSVRC2015](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/). It contains components such as **region proposal**, **still-image object detection**, **generic object tracking**, **spatial max-pooling** and **temporal convolution**.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [T-CNN](https://github.com/myfavouritekk/T-CNN) framework contains many tools that utilizes `vdetlib`. Please checkout that repository if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Citing vdetlib\r\nIf you find vdetlib useful in your research and related project, please consider citing the following work accepted in CVPR 2016.\r\n\r\n```latex\r\n@inproceedings{kang2016object,\r\n  Title = {Object Detection from Video Tubelets with Convolutional Neural Networks},\r\n  Author = {Kang, Kai and Ouyang, Wanli and Li, Hongsheng and Wang, Xiaogang},\r\n  Booktitle = {CVPR},\r\n  Year = {2016}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is released under the MIT License.\r\n\r\n## Installations\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n1. [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) with `Python layer` and `pycaffe`\r\n2. [FCN tracker](https://github.com/scott89/FCNT)\r\n3. `Matlab` with python [engine](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html?refresh=true)\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n        $ git clone https://github.com/myfavouritekk/vdetlib.git\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Compilation\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n        $ cd vdetlib\r\n        $ make\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n## Protocols\r\nThere are some basic protocol types for using this library. All of them are defined as python dictionaries and are saved as `JSON` files. The definitions are written in the [`protocol.py`](utils/protocol.py).\r\n\r\n\r\n## To-do list\r\n- [ ] detailed documentation\r\n- [ ] demo script\r\n",
